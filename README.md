Aura - Real-time Emotion and Sentiment Analysis
Aura is a web application that performs real-time emotion and sentiment analysis on live video and audio streams. It uses a deep learning model to analyze facial expressions and a separate model to analyze the sentiment of the user's speech, providing real-time feedback on their emotional state.

Features
Real-time Emotion Detection: Analyzes a user's facial expressions from a live video stream to detect emotions such as happy, sad, angry, neutral, and surprised.

Real-time Sentiment Analysis: Analyzes the user's speech from a live audio stream to determine the sentiment of their words (positive, negative, or neutral).

Interactive Dashboard: Displays the real-time emotion and sentiment analysis results in an intuitive and visually appealing dashboard.

Session History: Saves the results of each session, allowing users to track their emotional state over time.
